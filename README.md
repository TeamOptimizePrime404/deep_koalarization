# Deep Koalarization

Implementation of the deep neural network proposed in [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.03400) by Federico Baldassarre, Diego González Morín and Lucas Rodés-Guirao
This network colorizes black and white images in the lab color space using a U-net architecture, composed by a CNN and a classification network
